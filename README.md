For this Lab, we will install HIVE and PIG and start practicing with their basic functions separately. 
Both of these applications can either run on top of a working HDFS / Mapreduce cluster, or they can run in local mode.

# HIVE

1. Install Hive (see slides Week 3 and Manual link below)
   <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted>

2. Check examples to Create, Load, Query data with Hive (slide 17 onwards)
   <http://courses.coreservlets.com/Course-Materials/pdf/hadoop/07-Hive-01.pdf>
   
3. Create your own tables and load data from a .txt file you have created or downloaded, then practice some queries.
You can find more query examples at https://support.treasuredata.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001457347-Hive-Query-Language#hive-example-query-catalog

# PIG (come back to this after week 4 on PIG)

1. Install Pig <https://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.15.0/start.html>
(Optionally, install Hadoop / HDFS and Copy the source files to the HDFS)
